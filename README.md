## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based implementation of the **AlexNet** architecture from scratch. The goal is to build and train the model on a dataset of images to recognize patterns and classify them effectively.

Key features include:
- Training AlexNet from scratch using **PyTorch**.
- Implementing data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation.
- Support for saving and loading trained models.
- Visualization of model at different epochs
